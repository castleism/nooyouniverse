# Mac handoff — noo

Branch: `codex/mac-handoff-20260923`. App source: `mobile`. This is the source checkpoint used for the 23 September Android test build, with portable handoff documentation added. It is not a merge to main or a store release. Other upstream branches may contain later website changes; reconcile separately, do not discard this mobile work.

Read the repository instructions, then mac-handoff/REMAINING-WORK-AND-HANDOFFS.md. The guide-content.json and editable SVG artwork are included here for Gemini's iOS port. Ignore the old Windows paths in the portfolio report; the checked-out app path above is authoritative on your Mac. Android walkthrough code is provided as a reference and must be ported to iOS.

Install the runtime declared by the project and its locked dependencies. Flutter apps: run `flutter pub get`, `flutter test`, and `flutter build ios --simulator` from the app root if an iOS host exists. Capacitor apps: install locked web dependencies, build web assets, then run `npx cap sync ios` where an iOS host exists. Read platform READMEs first; some apps have only an iOS stub or no native host and need implementation. Do not regenerate Android package IDs or overwrite branded native resources.

No private phone records, production credentials or signing keys are included. A newly generated Android debug key on your Mac cannot update the existing phone installation; use the original key through a separate private transfer or verified export/import. Do not uninstall the phone apps to work around signing. Re-create missing standard Gradle wrappers using the project's documented Flutter/Gradle tooling if needed.

Cooked uses pnpm and Expo SDK 54. Run `pnpm install --node-linker=hoisted`, `pnpm check`, then create its missing iOS host with `pnpm exec expo prebuild --platform ios` on the Mac; review the generated project before signing. Its checked-in Android test build uses a standard local debug keystore, intentionally excluded. Generate a local debug key if building Android on a new machine; never label that a production release. USDA nutrition records are public reference data, not private food/lab logs. The full product roadmap remains open.
